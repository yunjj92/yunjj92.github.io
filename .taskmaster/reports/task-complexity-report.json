			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Create portfolio-home.html layout structure with semantic HTML5 sections, 2) Implement hero section with personal branding and responsive design, 3) Build featured projects section with Jekyll collection filtering (featured: true), 4) Add recent blog posts preview with Jekyll post limiting (3-5 latest), 5) Integrate call-to-action section with contact links and perform comprehensive responsive testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity (8/10) due to multiple interconnected components requiring Jekyll collections integration, Liquid templating, responsive design with existing SCSS/custom styling (no Tailwind CDN yet integrated), featured project filtering logic, blog post limiting, and comprehensive cross-device testing. The existing codebase shows custom SCSS styling with Korean fonts and specific navigation patterns that need to be maintained. Task already has 5 well-defined subtasks matching the recommended breakdown."
