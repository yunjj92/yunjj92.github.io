		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Separate Vite Entry Point from Jekyll Templates",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of index.vite.html into: 1) Analyzing existing Jekyll index.html structure and Liquid syntax usage, 2) Creating the new Vite-specific HTML entry file with proper DOCTYPE, meta tags, and asset imports, 3) Testing compatibility with both Vite and Jekyll build systems",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving HTML templating separation and build system compatibility. Requires understanding of both Jekyll Liquid templating and Vite entry point requirements, but is primarily file creation and configuration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Vite Build System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide Vite configuration into: 1) Update vite.config.js entry point to use index.vite.html, 2) Configure build output directory structure for Jekyll compatibility, 3) Set up asset handling and bundling configuration, 4) Configure base URL and public path settings for Jekyll integration",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to build system configuration requiring deep understanding of both Vite and Jekyll asset handling. Multiple configuration areas need coordination and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Complete hideLayer Function Implementation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the function implementation into: 1) Analyze current incomplete hideLayer function and requirements, 2) Implement core layer visibility toggling logic with DOM manipulation, 3) Add smooth animations and CSS class management, 4) Implement error handling and cross-browser compatibility testing",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity JavaScript function requiring DOM manipulation, animations, error handling, and cross-browser compatibility. Multiple technical aspects need careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Jekyll-Vite Build Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create build pipeline subtasks: 1) Design build process coordination strategy between Vite and Jekyll, 2) Create build script to run Vite build and asset copying, 3) Configure npm scripts for development and production builds, 4) Implement asset path resolution and integration with Jekyll _site directory, 5) Test complete integration pipeline and troubleshoot issues",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving coordination of two different build systems. Requires scripting, asset management, path resolution, and ensuring compatibility between different toolchains."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Development Server with HMR",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Set up development environment: 1) Configure Vite dev server on localhost:5173 with Jekyll compatibility, 2) Implement proxy or asset serving strategy between Jekyll and Vite servers, 3) Configure HMR for CSS and JS changes, 4) Create development scripts to run both servers simultaneously and test integration",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity requiring coordination of two development servers, proxy configuration, and HMR setup. Multiple moving parts need to work together seamlessly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CSS Build Pipeline with PostCSS",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Configure CSS processing: 1) Set up PostCSS pipeline configuration in Vite, 2) Configure autoprefixer, minification, and other PostCSS plugins, 3) Implement Tailwind CSS integration if needed and CSS optimization for production, 4) Set up CSS modules/scoping and development source maps",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity CSS pipeline setup requiring configuration of multiple PostCSS plugins, optimization settings, and integration with Vite. Multiple CSS processing steps need coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create GitHub Pages Deployment Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build deployment pipeline: 1) Create GitHub Actions workflow file with Node.js and Ruby environment setup, 2) Configure integrated build process (Vite + Jekyll) in CI environment, 3) Implement asset optimization and GitHub Pages deployment configuration, 4) Set up caching, permissions, and test deployment process",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity CI/CD pipeline requiring knowledge of GitHub Actions, multi-language environment setup, and coordination of complex build processes in CI environment."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Asset Versioning and Cache Busting",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Set up asset versioning: 1) Configure Vite to generate content-based hash names for assets, 2) Implement manifest file processing for Jekyll template integration, 3) Create system to inject versioned asset URLs into Jekyll layouts and includes, 4) Configure cache headers and test cache invalidation behavior",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity requiring coordination between Vite's asset hashing and Jekyll's templating system. Involves manifest processing and dynamic URL injection."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Image Optimization Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Configure image optimization: 1) Install and configure Vite image optimization plugins (vite-plugin-imagemin), 2) Set up automatic WebP/AVIF conversion with fallbacks, 3) Configure responsive image generation for different screen sizes, 4) Implement lazy loading and test optimization results across different image types",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving plugin configuration, multiple image format handling, and responsive image generation. Requires testing across different scenarios and optimization validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Lighthouse Scoring",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Comprehensive performance optimization already broken down into: 1) Initial Lighthouse audits and bottleneck identification, 2) JavaScript code splitting and bundle optimization, 3) Critical CSS extraction and delivery optimization, 4) Resource preloading and prefetching strategies, 5) Service worker and advanced caching implementation, 6) Final performance testing and score validation",
			"reasoning": "High complexity comprehensive performance optimization requiring deep knowledge of web performance, multiple optimization techniques, and coordination of various performance strategies. Already appropriately broken down into 6 subtasks."
